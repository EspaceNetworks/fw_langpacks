"This module provides a facility to install new and updated localization "
"translations for all components in FreePBX. Localization i18n translations "
"are still kept with each module and other components such as the User Portal "
"(ARI). This provides an easy ability to bring all components up-to-date "
"without the need of publishing dozens of modules for every minor change. The "
"localization updates used will be the latest available for all modules and "
"will not consider the current version you are running."
